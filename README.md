# FutureTest

  Long running methods are good candidates for asynchronous processing and the Future interface.
This enables us to execute some other process while we are waiting for the task encapsulated in Future to complete.
Some examples of operations that would leverage the async nature of Future are:

    computational intensive processes (mathematical and scientific calculations)
    manipulating large data structures (big data)
    remote method calls (downloading files, HTML scrapping, web services).

This simple app allows us to see, how it's work.
